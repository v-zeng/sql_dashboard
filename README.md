# Power BI Dashboards using SQL Data

This repository contains three Power BI dashboard projects that visualize data from SQL databases. Each project uses Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to create and manage the databases, and Power BI is used to build custom dashboards for each dataset.

## Projects

### 1. Hotels Revenue Report
This project focuses on a **hotel revenue report**, where the data includes hotel booking details, revenue, and occupancy rates. The dataset was created using SQL in SSMS, and the Power BI dashboard visualizes the hotel's performance, trends, and key metrics.

### 2. Pizza Restaurant Sales Report
In this project, we analyze sales data from a **pizza restaurant**, covering various aspects such as orders, sales by item, revenue per region, and peak sales times. SQL was used to structure and query the restaurantâ€™s sales database, and Power BI is used to create interactive visualizations of the sales trends.

### 3. Simulated Fundraising Report
This project is a **simulated fundraising report** that tracks donations, donor details, and fundraising campaign performance over time. The database was created in SQL using MS SSMS, and Power BI was used to visualize key insights from the simulated data, including total donations, donor segmentation, and campaign success.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: Used to create and manage the databases for each project.
- **Power BI**: Used to design and create custom dashboards for visualizing the data from each SQL database.

## How to Use
Each project folder contains the relevant Power BI report files (PBIX), along with SQL scripts used to generate the data for the dashboards. You can explore and modify these files in Power BI to further customize the visualizations.
